2D tiled turned base game in a 3D enviroment.

There are 4 different types of characters, including the player controlled one. 
Use the arrow keys to move, and space to swap your control to a character that is  on the neighboring tile as you.
If a character tries to move into a tile that has a character in it, it will attack the other character.
If the controlled character dies, it's game over. If anything else dies, a random AI spawns somewhere.
The shape tells you what stats the character has, like damage, health, speed, etc. The color tells you what AI is controlling it.
When you switch characters, Only the AI is moving, and the stats stay. So if you have a low health, you can change to another character that probably has full health.

Black Capsule:
    The controlled character. 
    Moves the fastest, but has very low damage.
    Pretty easy to use, and you can see how other AI moves better.

Red Cylinder:
    The AI will move towards the direction it is looking.
    It's pretty fast and has very high attack, but has very low health.

Blue Sphere:
    The AI will move in circles.
    A bit slow and has bery low damage, but it has lots of health.
    
Yellow Cube:
    The AI will chase the player. 
    Moves very slow, and has very low damage, but has lots of health.
    Swapping mind with Cube is a terrible idea, since they usually bunch up with other yellow AI, and you move so slow so whatever body you had that turned yellow will attack you multiple times per turn
